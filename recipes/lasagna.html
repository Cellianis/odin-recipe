        <ul>
            <li>1/2 lb lean ground meat</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
            <li>1 Can of tomato sauce, 28 ounces</li>
            <li>1 Can of crushed tomatoes, 8 ounces</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Parsley, divided</li>
            <li>1 Clove garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 dash of sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp dried basil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 (16oz) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 lb small-curd cottage cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (16 oz) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
                <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. </li>
                <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. </li>
                <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
                <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined. </li>
                <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes. </li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving. </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
        </p>
        <p class="tips">Feel free to substitute ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese for a more traditional cheese filling. You can also add layers of veggies (such as spinach and mushrooms) when layering your lasagna. </p>
